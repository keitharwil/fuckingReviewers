                    <li>
                        <b>The Mainframe Era</b>
                        <ul>
                            <li>From the late 1950s through the 1960s, computers were seen as a way to more efficiently do calculations.</li>
                            <li>Computers were room-sized monsters, with several refrigerator-sized machines linked together.</li>
                            <li>Only large businesses, universities, and government agencies could afford them.</li>

                    <li>
                        <b>The PC Revolution</b>
                        <ul>
                            <li>In 1975, the first microcomputer was announced on the cover of Popular Mechanics: the Altair 8800.</li>
                            <li>The most prominent of these early personal computer makers was Apple Computer, headed by Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak, with the hugely successful “Apple II.”</li>
                            <li>In 1981 IBM (teaming with Microsoft for their operating-system software) released their own version of the personal computer, simply called the “PC.”</li>
                            <li>The IBM PC was named Time magazine’s “Man of the Year” for 1982.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Client-Server</b>
                        <ul>
                            <li>In the mid-1980s, businesses began to see the need to connect their computers together as a way to collaborate and share resources.</li>
                            <li>This networking architecture was referred to as “client-server” because users would log in to the local area network (LAN) from their PC (the “client”) by connecting to a powerful computer called a “server”.</li>
                            <li>Software companies began developing applications that allowed multiple users to access the same data at the same time.</li>
                            <li>This evolved into software applications for communicating, with the first real popular use of electronic mail appearing at this time.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

                        <b>The World Wide Web and E-Commerce</b>
                        <ul>
                            <li>In 1989, Tim Berners-Lee developed a simpler way for researchers to share information over the network at CERN laboratories, a concept he called the World Wide Web.</li>
                            <li>As web browsers and Internet connections became the norm, companies rushed to grab domain names and create websites.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Web 2.0</b>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Websites became interactive; instead of just visiting a site to find out about a business and purchase its products, customers wanted to be able to customize their experience and interact with the business.</li>
                            <li>Web 2.0 is exemplified by blogging, social networking, and interactive comments being available on many websites.</li>
                            <li>This process of technology replacing a middleman in a transaction is called disintermediation.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <b>The Post-PC World</b>
                        <ul>
                            <li>After thirty years as the primary computing device used in most businesses, sales of the PC are now beginning to decline as sales of tablets and smartphones are taking off.</li>
                        </ul>
